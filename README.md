# LayersControl

LayersControl is a control inspired by [maplibre-gl-opacity](https://github.com/mug-jp/maplibre-gl-opacity). It integrates support for legends and several improvements in layer and transparency management.

## Features

- Layer Visibility: Easily show or hide individual layers.
- Transparency Management: Control the opacity of each layer to create custom visualizations.
- Legend Support: Integrates legends directly into the control for better context.
- Enhanced Management: Offers an improved user experience for managing map layers compared to the original plugin.
